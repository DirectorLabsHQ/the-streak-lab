# ⚡ The Streak Lab | Momentum Diagnostic Engine

### "Quantifying Neurological Habit Integration."
The Streak Lab is a behavioral science utility designed to calculate the "Automaticity Velocity" of habits. Part of the **DirectorLabsHQ** network.

## 🧪 Behavioral Foundation
Based on the **University College London (UCL)** study on habit formation, this diagnostic uses the 66-day automaticity model to determine how much cognitive effort is still required to maintain a behavior.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Momentum Velocity Engine:** Calculates the percentage of habit "lock-in" based on streak duration.
- **Phase Diagnostics:** Identifies whether a user is in the Cognitive Load, Structural Change, or Automaticity phase.
- **Momentum Bar:** Real-time visual representation of behavioral strength.

## 🔒 The DirectorLabsHQ Standard
The Streak Lab executes all behavioral logic client-side. We believe your habits are your business; we just provide the data to keep them alive.
