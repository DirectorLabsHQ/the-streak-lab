# 📈 The Streak Lab | Performance Intelligence Engine

### "Quantifying Momentum. Eliminating the Eye Test."
The Streak Lab is a high-performance analytics utility designed to identify statistical deviations in sports. We help bettors and analysts separate sustainable performance from temporary "heat."

## 🧪 The Heat Check v1.2 Engine
Our core algorithm calculates the **Heat Index** by measuring the variance between a player's long-term baseline (Season Average) and short-term momentum (Last 3 Games).

- **Critical Heat (>15% Variance):** Identifies players performing significantly above their mean. High probability of a "regression to the mean" or a breakout cycle.
- **Optimal Flow (±10% Variance):** Indicates stable, predictable performance suitable for high-confidence modeling.
- **Ice Cold (<-10% Variance):** Highlights significant underperformance, identifying potential "buy-low" opportunities or tactical slumps.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **UI:** Tailwind CSS (Vegas-Dark Theme)
- **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript with symmetric variance modeling.
- **Network:** Part of the **DirectorLabsHQ** performance suite.

## 🔒 Responsible Data
The Streak Lab provides statistical modeling for informational purposes only. We champion data-driven decision making and advocate for responsible gaming.
